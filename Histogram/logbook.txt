Caio's Log Book

I forgot we had to keep a log book until after I was done with the code. I figured it'd be 
better to just be honest about that instead of faking it and pretending like I had actually 
kept a log as I worked on the code.

I wrote 99% of the code in one sitting, on Monday the 5th (last monday). I sat down and worked 
from around 8pm or 9pm until 1:30am or so. I found that the first section of the code, making
the makeHistogram function work with a fixed input, was the most difficult section. Usually in
COSC101 it felt like the progression went from easy to hard. This difference isn't a bad thing,
just a difference I noticed. I actually liked this better since it felt like a natural progression
of code as opposed to the assignment holding my hand through it. After the makeHistogram function
worked, the rest was fairly easy. The only issue I ran into that took me a little bit of time to
resolve was getting the proper spacing when printing numbers of multiple digits, but I resolved
that and the rest was straightforward. The explanation for sorting was actually very clear in the
textbook, and made sense to me. 

Yesterday, on the 12th, I finished up the code by adding a few more comments and doing a little
bit of cleanup. I also realized I needed two different makeHistogram functions, one for a fixed
input and one for variable input, instead of just writing the function for fixed input and then
modifying it, so I added that. 

Today, on the 13th, I wrote this "logbook". It's unfortunately not a log book in the sense that
I kept track of my thought process as I developed my solution, but it includes my rationale for
how I felt about the assignment.
