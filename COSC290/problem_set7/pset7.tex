\section{Problem 1: Using induction to prove algorithm correctness, DLN 5.71}

\textbf{Claim}: Let $P(n)$ if for a sorted array $A[1...n]$ of length $n$, $binarySearch(A, x) \iff x \in A$ .  The claim is that $\forall n \in \mathrm{Z}^{\geq 0}: P(n)$.

\begin{proof}
We will prove by strong induction on $n$.

\textbf{Base cases}: The base cases are $n=0$ and $n=1$. Both $P(0)$ and $P(1)$ are true, as any array of length 0 or 1 is sorted.

\textbf{Inductive case}: Let $n \geq 2$.  We will show $P(0) \land ... \land P(n-1) \iff P(n)$.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Given}: Assume $P(0) \land ... \land P(n-1)$ is true.
\item \emph{Want to show}: $P(n)$ is true.
\end{itemize}
We proceed by cases. There are three ways in which $x$ can exist with relation to $A[1...n]$ and $middle$. These cases are as such: 
\begin{align*}
A[1...x=middle...n] \\
A[1...x...middle...n] \\
A[1...middle...x...n] \\
\end{align*}
In Case 1, we have that $x = middle$. In Case 2, we have that $1 \leq x < middle \leq n$. In Case 3, we have that $1 \leq middle < x \leq n$.

\emph{Case 1}: In the first case, the algorithm successfully found the item $x$ it was searching for. Thus, the function returns true. \\
\emph{Case 2}: In the second case, the function will be called recursively on $A[1...middle-1]$. From there\\
\emph{Case 3}: In the third case, the function will be called recursively on $A[middle+1...n]$. From there\\

\end{proof}

\section{Problem 2: proving a relation is a partial order}

\subsection{DLN 8.131}

A relation is a total order if it is a partial order where every pair is comparable ($\langle a,b \rangle \in R$ or $\langle b,a \rangle \in R$). To demonstrate that it is not a total order, we must simply identify an $(a,b)$ pair that does not satisfy the total order condition. An example is as follows.\\
The pair $\langle \langle 1,2 \rangle , \langle 2,2 \rangle \rangle$ would be in $R$ as it meets the condition of the relation. Additionally, the pair $\langle \langle 2,1 \rangle , \langle 2,2 \rangle \rangle$ would also be in $R$. However, neither $\langle \langle 2,1 \rangle , \langle 1,2 \rangle \rangle$ nor $\langle \langle 1,2 \rangle , \langle 2,1 \rangle \rangle$ would be in $R$, as neither meet the condition. Thus, this relation $R$ does not meet the definition of a total order, and thus is not a total order.

\subsection{DLN 8.132}

For $R$ to be a partial order, it must be reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. We will show that relation $R$ meets each of these properties.
 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Reflexivity:} $\langle \langle a,b \rangle , \langle x,y \rangle \rangle \in R$ if $a \leq x$ and $b \leq y$. Thus $\langle \langle a,b \rangle , \langle a,b \rangle \rangle \in R$ as $a \leq a$ and $b \leq b$. Therefore this relation is reflexive, as for any $(a,b)$ pair $A$, $\langle A,A \rangle \in R$.
\item \textbf{Antisymmetry:} The antisymmetry property is only present if $\langle A,B \rangle \in R \land \langle B,A \rangle \in R \implies (A=B)$, where $A$ is the pair $(a,b)$ and $B$ is the pair $(x,y)$. If $\langle A,B \rangle \in R \land \langle B,A \rangle \in R$, then by the definition of $R$, $(a \leq x) \land (b \leq y)$ as well as $(x \leq a) \land (y \leq b)$. This is only possible if $a=x$ and $b=y$, as it is not possible to have $a < x < a$ or $b < y < b$. Additionally, if $a=x$ and $b=y$, then we must have $A=B$, and thus the relation $R$ is antisymmetric. 
\item \textbf{Transitivity:} The property of transitivity holds that if $\langle A,B \rangle \in R \land \langle B,C \rangle \in R$, then we must have that $\langle A,C \rangle \in R$. We have that $A$ is the pair $(a,b)$ and $B$ is the pair $(x,y)$, and $C$ is the pair $(c,d)$. If we have $\langle A,B \rangle \in R \land \langle B,C \rangle \in R$, then it must be that $(a \leq x) \land (b \leq y)$, as well as $(x \leq c) \land (y \leq d)$. It also holds that $(a \leq c) \land (b \leq d)$, and thus $\langle A,C \rangle \in R$, fulfilling the property of transitivity.
\end{itemize}

As the relation $R$ is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive, it is a partial order. 

\section{Problem 3: an equivalence relation and a partial order? DLN 8.155}

\textbf{Claim}: There exists a relation $\preceq$ on the set $A$ that is both an equivalence relation and a partial order.

\begin{proof}
We will prove by direct proof, by showing an example of a relation that fits both the definition of an equivalence relation and a partial order.
\\
A relation is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. A relation is a partial order if it is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. Thus for a relation to be both, it must be reflexive, symmetric, transitive, and antisymmetric simultaneously. We will show that the relation $R$ fits all of these properties. The relationship $R$ is defined as such: with relation to $A[1...n]$, $\langle a,b \rangle \in R$ if $a=b$. We will show that each property holds individually.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Reflexivity:} As for any element $a \in A[1...n]$ , $a=a$, then $\forall a \in A$, $\langle a,a \rangle \in R$. This is exactly the definition of reflexivity, and thus the relationship $R$ is reflexive.
\item \textbf{Symmetry:} The property of symmetry exists if $\forall \langle a,b \rangle \in R$, we must have $\langle b,a \rangle \in R$. Since we have $\langle a,b \rangle \in R$, it must be that $a=b$, and that $b=a$. Thus, it holds that $\langle b,a \rangle \in R$. Therefore, the relationship $R$ is symmetric. 
\item \textbf{Antisymmetry:}
\item \textbf{Transitivity:}
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
