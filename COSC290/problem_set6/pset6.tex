$R_1$ is an equivalence relationship if and only if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Reflexivity}: If $A$ is an empty set, then the $A = A = \emptyset$, so $\langle A,A \rangle \in R_1$. If $A$ is not an empty set, then the greatest element in $A$ will equal the greatest element in $A$, because $A=A$, thus $\langle A,A \rangle \in R_1$. Therefore $R_1$ is reflexive.
\item \emph{Symmetry}: In the case that $A = \emptyset$ and $\langle A,B\rangle \in R_1$, then by the second condition $B = \emptyset$. Therefore, also by the second condition, $\langle B,A\rangle \in R_1$. In the case that $\langle A,B\rangle \in R_1$ and $A \neq \emptyset$, the greatest element in $A$ must equal the greatest element in $B$. This means that the greatest element of $B$ must equal the largest element in $A$, and so $\langle B,A\rangle \in R_1$, making $R_1$ symmetric.
\item \emph{Transitivity}: If $\langle A,B \rangle \in R_1$ and $\langle B,C \rangle \in R_1$, and $A = \emptyset$, then $A=B=\emptyset$, and thus $B=C=\emptyset$. Therefore, if $A$,$B$, and $C$ are all empty sets, then $A=C=\emptyset$, and so $\langle A,C \rangle \in R_1$. In the case that $A$ is not an empty set, then the greatest element in $A$ must equal the greatest element in $B$. Since $\langle B,C \rangle \in R_1$, then the greatest element in $B$ must equal the greatest element in $C$. Thus, the greatest element in $A$ must equal the greatest element in $C$, therefore $\langle A,C \rangle \in R_1$. This means that the relation must be transitive.
\end{itemize}
Since the relation $R_1$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, it is an equivalence relationship. The equivalence clauses are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\{ \emptyset\} $
\item $\{ \{0\}\} $
\item $\{ \{1\}, \{0,1\}\} $
\item $\{ \{2\}, \{0,2\}, \{1,2\}, \{0,1,2\}\} $
\item $\{ \{3\}, \{0,3\}, \{1,3\}, \{2,3\}, \{0,1,3\}, \{0,2,3\}, \{1,2,3\}, \{0,1,2,3\}\} $
\end{itemize}

$R_1$ is an equivalence relationship if and only if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. $P = \mathcal{P}(\{0,1,2,3\})$. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Reflexivity}: The sum of the items in $A$ will always equal the sum of items in $A$. Thus, for every $A \in P, \langle A,A \rangle \in R_2$. Therefore, the relation is reflexive.
\item \emph{Symmetry}: If the sum of items in $A$ equals the sum of items in $B$, the reverse must also be true. Therefore, for every $A,B \in P$, if $\langle A,B \rangle \in R_2$, then $\langle B,A \rangle \in R_2$. This means that $R_2$ is symmetric. 
\item \emph{Transitivity}: If $\langle A,B \rangle \in R_2$, then the sum of elements in $A$ equals the sum of elements in $B$. If $\langle B,C \rangle \in R_2$, then the sum of elements in $B$ must equal the sum of elements in $C$. Thus, the sum of elements in all three sets ($A,B,$ and $C$) must be equal, giving us $\langle A,C \rangle \in R_2$. This means that the relation $R_2$ is transitive.
\end{itemize}
Since the relation $R_1$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, it is an equivalence relationship. The equivalence clauses are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\{ \emptyset\} $
\item $\{ \{0\}\} $
\item $\{ \{1\}, \{0,1\}\} $
\item $\{ \{2\}, \{0,2\}\} $
\item $\{ \{3\}, \{0,3\}, \{1,2\}, \{0,1,2\}\} $
\item $\{ \{1,3\}, \{0,1,3\}\} $
\item $\{ \{2,3\}, \{0,2,3\}\} $
\item $\{ \{1,2,3\}, \{0,1,2,3\}\} $
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem 2: DLN 8.84}

\textbf{Claim}: The claim is that for any relation $R \subseteq A \times A$ that is both irreflexive and transitive, $R$ must also be asymmetric. 

\begin{proof}
We will prove by assuming the claim is false and showing a contradiction.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Given}: Assume a relation $R \subseteq A \times A$ is irreflexive, transitive, and not asymmetric.  
\item \emph{Want to show}: The assumption leads to a contradiction.
\end{itemize}
By the definition of asymmetry, since $R$ is not asymmetric there must be one pair $\langle a,b\rangle \in R$ such that $\langle b,a\rangle \in R$. By the definition of transitivity, if $\langle a,b \rangle \in R$, and $\langle b,a\rangle \in R$, then $\langle a,a\rangle \in R$. Thus, if $R$ is not asymmetric and transitive, then we must have $\langle a,a \rangle \in R$.
\\
\\
By the definition of irreflexivity, for every $a \in A, \langle a,a\rangle \notin R$. By the assumption, $R$ is not asymmetric and is transitive, thus $\langle a,a \rangle \in R$, and is also irreflexive, thus for every $a \in A, \langle a,a\rangle \notin R$. These two statements are in direct contradiction, therefore if $R$ is both irreflexive and transitive, it must be asymmetric, proving the claim.


\end{proof}
