I am Caio Brighenti, a student at Colgate University.

This is a repository of my work in the Computer Science at Colgate University. This is intended to simplify my workflow, as I work on multiple machines, and to serve as practice with using Git. 

This is NOT intended to be a source of answers for those working on the same problems. Do NOT copy this work if you are enrolled in the same courses.
