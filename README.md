# COSC102

This is a repository of my work in COSC102 at Colgate University. This is intended to simplify my workflow, as I work on multiple machines, and to serve as practice with using Git. This is NOT intended to be a source of answers for those working on the same problems. Do NOT copy this code if you are also a student.
