	The strongest points of my code are most definitely the initial functionality of Table, Pair and FrequencyList, in which a table of frequency is built and printed. This is because I had a good grasp of the problem to solve and did it very thoughtfully. Unfortunately, I did not do the same for the word generation aspect of the problem, due to poor time management and frustrations arisen from course registration that resulted in me finishing and writing this readme with only 13 (Go Gate) minutes to go until the deadline. 
	My code is also lackingin the proper management of command line arguments, but I feel I didn't have enough experience with that to know how to cleanly use it. My file reading code is also not something I'm entirely comfortable with. It works, but I wasn't sure how exactly to do file reading in Java and it took a lot of googling. 
	The example files I provided were the Shakespeare file provided, and a paper in English I wrote for my Legacies of the Ancient World course. The outputs are mostly what you'd expect from a long file; 60% gibberish that resembles english to 40% actual words. The following is some of the output of the Shakespeare file:

	His a mis will fooke ron a pidee sall on in, of I dry yould old cou hear bous next thath, to de whipanch
       Rosal ing this a voun ance, an is the traway waggart me sir pasch ars hat he; se

      And of the academic paper:

      wit a somerialle tore asubming on explatery the ever mot Achat factive comy of Zeus? 

    The output of the paper is somewhat more jumbled, but some key words like Zeus and Homer appear that show the code's ability to accurately represent what is in a file, as the paper is about a Homerian epic.

    The console arguments all work as well, and I've tested the code for such. The default output without arguments is the academic paper, with a starting seed of the first two letters, and a maximum length of 1000.

    All in all, this was an incredibly fun and interesting project to do. I wish I'd managed my time better and written a cleaner final product. I'll probably end upg oing abck and doing that just for fun anyways.
