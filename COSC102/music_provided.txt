COSC 102 - Assignment 5

My song is a simplied version of the Brazilian national anthem. I found a simple version showing each of the notes on the following website: https://cifrasparaflauta.wordpress.com/2010/05/03/hino-nacional-brasileiro/

 I used these notes, and I used my knowledge of the song in my head to figure out how long they should be and where there should be rests.

 Our Melody code is fully functional.
