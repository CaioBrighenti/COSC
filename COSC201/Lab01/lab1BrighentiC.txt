The result of prog1 gets placed in x0, which is the register designated for the resulting value. chckprog1 then knows where to find that result, as it is placed in the standard register for function results. The last line of prog1 returns the code to chkprog1 by creating a branch to the address at x30, which is the standard register for the return address. The return address is just the address the machine is intended to return to after it is done executing the function. For this to work, the parameters must be stored somewhere where the function called can find them, the original register values must be stored if the function plans to use the same registers, and the return address must be stored in a register so that the program knows where to head to after completing the function call. Finally, the resulting value of the function is stored ina  place where the caller can find it.
